        "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and organize code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is based on the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** This involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of the object and exposing only what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** This allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** This enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types of objects, making the code more flexible and adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:** This involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics they share. Abstraction helps in managing the complexity of large software systems."

        "In Python, the self parameter in class methods serves as a reference to the instance of the class itself.
